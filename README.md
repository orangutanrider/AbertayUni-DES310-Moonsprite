# DES310 Moonsprite group project
DES310 was a module at Abertay that we did in groups. Team members were mixed discipline, coming from different courses. We worked to create a game or project, working with an academic tutor, and a client that would propose the brief for the project. Extracts from the official description can be found below.

## Module Description
For this module, students will be required to work together on an interactive media project as part of a multidisciplinary team. Individual students will be expected to contribute to their team by taking on a professional role suited to their area of study. As part of the module, all students will be expected to: communicate with clients and relevant stakeholders; participate in pitching and presentations; research and test technical pipelines; create project documentation and planning materials; and contribute to the iterative design and development of a final interactive prototype.

### Aims
The aim of this module is to provide the student with the ability to operate professionally as a subject specialist within a multidisciplinary development team, contributing to planning, presenting, prototyping, and production.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module the student should be able to:

1. Contribute to the development, testing, enhancement, and completion of a defined interactive media project.
2. Demonstrate the ability to fulfil and appraise their own defined professional role within a team, evaluating their contribution in relation to expectations of the comparable role in industry.
3. Demonstrate teamwork, communication, and professionalism through collaboration on- and delivery of- a team project.
